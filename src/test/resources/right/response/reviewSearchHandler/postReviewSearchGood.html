I just don't like the rounded shape because I was always bumping it and Siri kept popping up and it was irritating. I just won't buy a product like this again</th><th>4.0</th></tr><tr><th>3998899561</th><th>Good case, solid build. Protects phone all around with good access to buttons. Battery charges with full battery lasts me a full day. I usually leave my house around 7am and return at 10pm.

It looks pretty good and It works with my Iphone (3GS) and my phone (HTC Evo V 3D). It is a good deal because It is not easy to find something like this for this price</th><th>4.0</th></tr><tr><th>7887421268</th><th>I loved the case when I first received it but shortly after, the case started to peel off at first i did not know what it was until i looked on the back of the case and it was missing spots. Guess sometimes a good deal is not really a good deal.would not purchase.</th><th>2.0</th></tr><tr><th>8199406933</th><th>very good charger, it woks fine, no complaints!!! I would recommend it!! It was good, but not using it anymore!</th><th>4.0</th></tr><tr><th>8288878881</th><th>First off, the charger works just as it should and all the ports stay connected just fine.People in other reviews were complaining that the cord was too short-- about 2 or 3 feet-- and that was what I was expecting. Instead, I got a 5 foot cord which is a bit long for the purpose I was going to use it for (in my car). Now I have a long cord dangling everywhere. That extra length may be a bonus for most, but I bumped down the rating due to seller's lack of description and/or consistency. Also I'm fairly certain the product image was changed because when I ordered it, a different style adapter was pictured... I was expecting a square shape with the USB port on the side; I got the longer rectangle shape with the USB port on the end... hmm. There's no way to verify that now.In sum: Good charger with good connectivity, looks and acts like it's an original Samsung.  Cord length and adapter style may vary as it seems like the seller is not consistent.</th><th>3.0</th></tr><tr><th>8288878881</th><th>I am pleased with this purchase.  The detachable cable option gives very good flexibility for use with other USB cable chargers.  Good quality for a travel charger.</th><th>5.0</th></tr><tr><th>9861203192</th><th>nice case, protective and good looking, it also has a nice changing texture in some areas. good buy for the price</th><th>4.0</th></tr></table><form id='reviewSearchForm' method='POST'>
