<td>My previous phone was a Nokia 6600. It had a slow interface for 2006 and come on, I wanted to try somethingn new.Initially, I had planned on exploring my chances of buying a Treo but due to the rates, I gave up my plan. Without much pondering, I went and purchased a Sony Ericsson W810i. Now, it's been four weeks. Let me just give you a brief run thru of features, pros and cons.Features1. This phone is an mp3 player. This phone is a torch/semi flash light(with an SOS signal that can be configured). This phone has flash capability and further doubles up into a digital camera. Overall, it saves a lot of space to use this phone instead of just going out with a standalone mp3 player or/and a digital camera2. The interface is fast. It takes around 8 seconds to get an auto focus and click a picture using the camera. I'll try and explain - to come out of the screensaver you need half a second, to activate camera using the shortcut it takes 3 seconds, a further 2 seconds for auto focus and an additional 1 second to click you picture. Overall,8 seconds to click one image.You can browse thru pictures very quickly. It's around 7 times faster than my Nokia. Images can be clicked in sepia, black and white, solarise(kinda yellowey), negative and normal modes. Brightness can be reduced within the click of a button. I noticed grains on images of larger size. I don't recommend using the flash camera unless you really must. Plus while clicking a video, the light goes on and off, if the flash light is turned on.3. The build quality on the phone is both good and bad. I love the keypad and it is a major improvement from the 800i and sundry walkman phones. It took me three days to get used to the keypad. The dictionary like function on the phone keeps a track of all the words you spell. So they're definitely there the next time around. The front of the phone seems to appear too plastic. Especially the silver scroll keys and sometimes can make your phone look like a dummy piece. The sound speakers are situated on the backside of the phone and can be used conveniently even when the phone is upside down. You can insert your memory stick pro cards even when the phone is switched on. There is NO CAMERA SHUTTER like the previous installment of this phone (800i) The power button is placed most effectively just like the volume buttons on the right side of the phone which can be used for a host number of features.4. The internal memory of this phone is 22mb and the accompanied card contains 512mb worth of memory. The usable memory,however, is only 431mb. Upon connecting to the pc, both are instantly recognized and act as removable drives on the &quot;my computer&quot; icon. The accompanied software is almost brilliant. I loved &quot;Disc2phone&quot; and there is so much more I keep discovering about the other programs. Despite lacking an English Manual, I found I didnt need one because I don't know too many people who would buy a sony ericsson phone and not be techies in their own rights who like to configure things on their own.5. The bundled earphones are sublime. I cannot beleive the sound on these. They cancel all the noises in a room and it's a pleasure listening to beethoven playing away or Enya's mesmerising voice or even Tool's prog metal for that matter. The speakers are satisfactory and could have been louder. If used as a stand alone mp3 player with earphones, the phone would stand for around 6-7 hours.Playing the music without using earphones can eat up battery depending on the volumes of course. It supports m4a, mp3 and aac formats(and a few other formats)6. The messages memory of the phone is limited to around 150+ messages and that is a big blunder. Despite having a 512mb of external storage the phone cannot accommodate a mere 200 messages. The size of notes is limited and you need to make a second note to carry on. Bluetooth transfers to Samsung,Nokia phones runs at 20kbps while it's a consistent 40kbps for Sony Ericsson phones. Very good for transferring media.Pros- It can be called an ipod replacement. I don't use mine quarter as much as I used to. This is owing to the absolutely brilliant earphones that sit within your ear and help you celebrate your time.- I love how the phone slides into a digital camera. Good build quality for the particular feature.- Good standby, saves battery, easy to work with 50% brightness. Even when I reduce brightness from 100% to 50% (lowest possible) there is hardly any noticeable difference on the screen. The keypad is much lighter but that's hardly noticeable.- Fast processor, super graphics and wallpaper options, includes a good browser, calendar, good default themes- The accompanied torch can be used to change a flat tire and can be switched on for 25mins even when the remaining battery is only 15%. (tried and tested)- Good keypad(KEY FEATURE), good playlist configuring options- Excellent software for the phone, mp3s can transferred at variable bit-rates without taking too long- Excellent,fast log, the phones keeps track off the last ten numbers you've messaged and keeps them around for easy usage- It's easy to store numbers cause the phone prompts to save numbers when a call from an unknown number ends- Great handsfree- There is a memory stick converter (The longer ones used in cameras) and that is a handy thing- The MACRO mode helps in copying handwritten/type written documents using the cameraCons- too plastic, looks a bit boring too soon, screen can be scratched if no touchscreen is present- the accompanied tones for messages is sad, the message memory is very limite (Big DEMERIT) and the size of a note is limited- Call quality is not as good as can be- sometimes it takes over a minute for the phone to recognize it has been plugged into a USB slot- the accompanied FM radio needs to be in place to avoid screechiness in sound and proper volume- Even though the phone provides 512mb worth of external memory, only 431mb is useable. Ideally, i'd have liked a one gig card so I could have doubled on my usage.- Not enough upgradations over the W800i. People can settle for that phone because it has a slightly better talk life- IT HAS NO ENGLISH MANUAL- noticeable grains on 2megapixel imagesConclusion,All though I am very happy with this phone, I cant help but throw a fit over the limited message storage, you can save messages onto your pc but come on, who's gonna do that?Buy this phone if you like what you read. Not enough reasons to upgrade for 800i owners. BUT this phone has more appeal than 800i and has better more smooth graphics. There is a much better display and there is an improvement of 25% which I just noticed.However, unlike the 550i , there are no three way speakers and that makes &quot;Stereo Widening&quot; impossible.Overall rating - 7/10Very little to complain about,reallyGood luck,fellow techies</td>

<td>I purchased this unit primarily to use with my MacBook and Skype for conducting business calls.  Previously I was using the Logitech Clear Chat Pro wired USB headset with very good results, but after breaking a couple of them by accidentally yanking the cords from my Mac, I wanted to try a wireless solution.  So far, the results have been mixed.  Here are some highlights:1. Build Quality - 3 starsThe build quality seems pretty good, especially for something in this price range.  The construction is mostly all plastic, but the hinge mechanisms and stress points appear to be adequately constructed.  I would NOT expect these headsets to stand up to much abuse - e.g. extensive travel where they are jammed in and out of a bag, dropped on the ground, etc.  For daily office or home use where they are place into a drawer or on a desk when not in use, they should give a good service life.  People have complained that the foam earpieces fall off, but after a couple weeks of use, I have not seen any indications of this problem.  The switches all operate smoothly, and while the overall design is a bit clunky, that is more an aesthetic comment than a quality comment.2. Features - 4 starsThe headset has a good feature set, supporting both the stereo headphone profile (A2DP) and the &quot;headset&quot; profile.  I have used these with both my Mac and my iPhone and with the Mac both profiles work, with easy switching between the two using the &quot;Bluetooth Preferences&quot; drop down for on-the-fly changes.  With the iPhone, only the &quot;headset&quot; profile is supported (this is an iPhone limitation, NOT a limitation of this headset).  Buttons for volume, skip/fast forward, skip/fast rewind work well with iTunes on the laptop.  Only the volume controls and &quot;call answer/end&quot; buttons seem to work with the iPhone in the headset mode.3. Operation/usage  - 2 starsPairing with both the Mac and the iPhone was absolutely seamless, and switching between the two is fairly straightforward, though I have not tried to have the headset paired and connected to both devices - I'm not sure this works.  For now, I disable Bluetooth on my iPhone when it is nearby and I want to pair the PT590 to my Macbook, because otherwise the PT590 will connect to its last device, which is usually my iPhone when on the road.  The comfort of these headphones is so-so - the ear pads are relatively small, and the over-the-head band is quite tight (and I have a small head).  I can imagine that they would be quite uncomfortable for anyone with a large melon.  Stretching the band would be dangerous, since it is made of plastic and would probably break.  perhaps heating it with a blow dryer and gently stretching it out might work...  The foam ear pads are thin, and since the ear pieces press pretty firmly against the head, they do cause minor discomfort after some period of time.  They are no where near as comfortable as my Bose QCII headphones, but these are $60 and the Bose are $300, so I would expect that to be the case.  They are more comfortable than other headphones I have had in this &amp;lt;$100 price range, including both wired and wireless units.  I would not recommend them for all-day use sitting at a desk (get the Bose and live with the wires), but for short stints they are great.The blue light is annoying, but it is also an important status indicator for things like call status and battery life.  It is one of the ways my wife knows when I am on a call in my office when she walks in to talk to me.Operating the unit is very easy - answering a call, you touch a button, the same button ends the call. For listening to music, the controls are a bit less intuitive - the top and bottom buttons skip forward or reverse, and the front and rear buttons increase or decrease the volume - this seems like it was not thought out very well, as the functions between the two pairs of buttons should be swapped to be more intuitive.The pull-out boom for the mic is a nice feature, and there is a built-in wind screen.  I have not tried these units in windy conditions but would expect their performance to exceed many other &quot;mini&quot; headsets for mobile phone usage.One &quot;nit&quot; I have is that in order to get the boom mic to point down towards one's mouth, the headband needs to sit pretty far forward on the head - it feels slightly unnatural.  So this leaves you with the choice of either tilting the whole setup forward to angle the mic towards the mouth, or put them on feeling more natural, but have the mic pointed up at one's nose/cheek.Note:  I use these headphones alongside a logitech bluetooth mouse and have been surprised at how little interference there is between the two.  Occasionally my mouse will freeze, but a click will usually quickly restore service to the mouse.  There is no static induced in the headphones by the mouse that I can discern.4. Performance - 4 stars for music,  2 stars for SkypeOverall performance of these units is quite good, with the exception of VOIP or Skype calling.4.1 Music - music sounds surprisingly full and rich, given that these units are small and rather flimsy feeling (e.g. lightweight).  The are &quot;on the ear&quot; style headphones, so they do not offer any passive noise reduction, and the sound leakage from the outside into the ears as well as from the 'phones to the outside is pretty significant (I can't watch a movie on my laptop in bed while my wife is trying to sleep - something I do routinely with my Bose QCII headphones).  But for average music listening, they are really surprisingly good.  By tweaking the EQ settings, you can get them to sound as good or better than many wired headphones in this price range, and the amount of stutter or static is surprisingly low.4.2 Skype - 1 star - I cannot recommend these units for Skype - Out use.  This may be a limitation of Bluetooth for VOIP calling, as I have not tried other Bluetooth sets, the amount of lag introduced by these units is unacceptable for business-level conversation.  I know that this is not a limitation of Skype, as I previously used a wired Logitech headset with very good results with Skype.  The lag can vary in severity, but even at its best, it is noticeable - almost like talking to someone over a satellite connection where there is several hundred milliseconds of delay.  It can get annoying very quickly.  At its worst, it is totally unusable, as people I am talking to hear nothing but static and garbled speech.  I have reached the point where I really only use them when I am on long conference calls where I just have to listen for 95% of the time.  For real calls, I have had to go back to using my cell phone.4.3 Phone - 5 stars - probably the best quality audio (both mic and speakers) that I have used with my iPhone or my Motorola Razr.  The headphones are big and dorky looking while walking through an airport, but boy, they sure stay on your head when you lean over to pick up your bag, and they seem to do a great job of filtering out background noise.Overall, the performance of these units is very good for the price.  If you are buying them for music and /or for use with a phone (especially one that supports the A2DP profile)  I highly recommend them - you cannot beat the performance at this price point.  For use with Skype at a desktop computer, I cannot recommend them, and suggest you use a wired USB or audio jack type headset.</td>

<td>I hung on to my old v60i in the hope that Motorola would fix their user interface, this one is substantially different, but the bad features of the v60i remain. The side buttons.As of 5/22/08 I'm about ready to hurl this from the roof. The UI is just too inconvenient. I've also had to replace the battery once.6/13/08 Enough already! I replaced it with a Nokia E51. On the E51 the side buttons are not too sensitive, they require deliberate use, and all buttons are automatically locked after a timeout period anyway. The E51 is nearly twice the price now but 10 times the phone (GSM quad band, WCDMA dual band, 802.11g an FM radio and god knows what else that I haven't found yet). I have temporarily given the KRZR to my significant other, but I'll be replacing that and the daughter's phones with Nokia phones when we change the plan to use the E51's data capabilities; why would I inflict on her what I wasn't happy with myself?Let's do the good first: The voice quality in both directions is good, the talk time is good and the standby time is good enough that I am surprised when it needs recharging. I use it quite a lot and that still only seems to be twice a week. The ring tones are the usual selection but the maximum volume is considerably higher than in my old phone. Signal handling is much better, it holds on to calls that AT&amp;T; could previously be relied on to drop, but there are still issues where it fails to roam to the next cell, though I strongly suspect that is due to lame network software rather than the phone (symptoms are that after a dropped call with no signal the signal strength immediately maxes out). For someone who travels to Europe the quad band GSM is indispensable, I keep a spare SIM for UK visits because it gives me calls to the US for about 1/10th of the cost of allowing AT&amp;T; to roam to Europe. The music player is fine, but you are going to have to either buy bluetooth headphones, which you can't use on a plane, or buy the USB adapter which should have been included for the trivial cost in such an expensive phone. It makes an excellent alarm clock and is loud as hell.The not so good: The iTap text entry is slow and not as good as the old version, whatever that was called. I guess I'll eventually get used to iTap, but the old predictive text had some advantages.The Ugly: the joker who came up with these side buttons that can't be disabled should be fired. It's the easiest thing in the world to brush against the phone and fire up the crummy voice entry (below) or, with a bit more of a rubbing motion, switch the ringer from one more to another. So you can silence the phone and drop it in your pocket only to find it ringing in the middle of a movie. Or you eventually notice nobody is talking to you and check the phone only to find you have a couple of missed calls and the phone has been set to silent. Somehow. Then there's the voice entry, the best you could say is that it's not good. If you brush against the voice button it thinks about it for a good while and then some awful woman say &quot;say a command&quot;. Now you have to try and convince it to call someone based on the phone's attempt at pronouncing the name you used in the phone book. Since I work with a load of Indians and Chinese that's about as much use as a chocolate fireguard. It was much more useful to be able to program the nicknames.But would I buy it again? Yes. There aren't many neat phones like this and if there's another one with quad band GSM too I didn't find it.But if someone comes out with a quad band GSM phone with good signal handling and no side buttons you'll see my KRZR on Ebay the next day.</td>

<td>I'm a long-running Virgin customer, but additionally I work as a developer in the mobile industry, and so I've had experience using literally scores of handsets from every imaginable carrier (including non-US). Previous Virgin phones I've used include the Vox 8610 and Kyocera 2255. My 8610 still works, but it's a bit bulky and heavy for my tastes and I decided to upgrade.Let's start with the positives:-Very compact design. This is probably the cheapest phone of its size/capabilities available anywhere. It is so thin that when I put it in the same pocket as my wallet, I sometimes forget it's there.-For the cost, it is pretty decent in terms of features. 128x128 screen with fullscreen graphic support, 10 MB for downloads (32 total), speakerphone, web capability, comparable performance to most Nokia series 40 devices. Very long battery life, and fast charging. For those that have had trouble with the battery I suggest you try turning off the backlight. It might have... interesting... effects.-Uses the Sprint network. I've found this to be very reliable in my area, and signal quality is excellent both in and outdoors.-Call quality is good. Comparable to the 8610 as far as I can tell, which was also good (my old Kyocera, on the other hand, was garbage).-UI has a solid, standard design. Predictive text included for messaging. The phone's graphics are a bit odd, but not necessarily in a bad ways.-Durable. UTStarcom knows how to build to last. This handset is no exception.-Good library of games, ringtones, and graphics available. Now I actually have something to spend all that balance on...-Virgin is a very low cost provider. It's no good if you want video on demand, 3G, or whatnot. But for just making calls/texting now and then, you simply can't beat $20/3 months. No annual contract as well, which is a huge plus (as many who've had one know all too well).On the downside:-Keys are a bit small. This is typical of ultra-thin handsets. They are a bit stiff as well, which is good and bad (good because you won't accidentally press them as easily, bad because typing is more of a pain).-Virgin's web browser is lame. Their web service costs extra, and it has problems viewing many page formats (says 'network gremlins' when you try... cute). You can browse basic html, and that's about it- good luck reading e-mail with it.-No bluetooth built-in, though this is to be expected.-No camera either, also to be expected. This can actually be a good thing, since camera phones are off-limits in more areas than you might expect.Bottom line: this handset is great for the price. There are flaws with it, as with any phone, but the pluses outweigh the minuses. I've seen many reviewers complain about both Virgin and the phone, but in my professional opinion (and it is an expert opinion) these people need to realize that you get what you pay for. This isn't a $200 Samsung T519, and you're not paying $60 a month for service on a 2 year contract. Considering the costs, the Slice is an great handset with excellent service, and that is that.</td>

<td>Oh Boy, where do I start a review for this product.I saw this product on Sale at Dell website and overly impressed with the specs and the reviews on Amazon - almost immediately I ordered one for myself and just about to order another one for my wife.  I put it on hold till I try out one of them - glad that I did not order the 2nd one.Initially I did not like the idea of going for a $30 data plan with At&amp;t; and being stuck to a service provider for 2 long years and badly wanted to buy something with no data plan.Let me break down each of the feature functionality of this product in detail - it is probably the most detailed review you will find on this product.  First the good part and then the bad stuffAs a phone - receive/make calls  :  10/10===============================Full marks to Nokia as a phone - the phone has excellent signal reception, compared to any of the smart phones out there in the market.  I have used a blackberry/iphone/samsung and Nokia score above allCamera (stills) : 5/10===============Camera is good for outdoors, but very poor for indoors - the photos look very grainy.  Front camera is decent and you can use it to make video calls with your friends running fring on their iPhone/Android and other nokiaCamera (video) : 7/10===============Video quality is excellent, I have shot a few videos outdoors and almost compares to HD qualityCamera/Video/Front/Rear switch : 2/10==============================Since the phone feature video, stills, front &amp; rear camera: Switching from a video to still and back to video.  Switching from front to rear camera and back is so difficult and non-intuitive.  I am a pretty good geek with stuff and I found it extremely difficult and confusing to switch between different modes.Calender, Memo... : 5/10======================Can sync with Exchange on your computer, but cannot sync directly with exchange servers unlike android/iphones which can directly connect to your company servers.  Which means, everytime, you need to connect the phone to the computer for syncMusic player/Video : 7/10==================Music player output is very good, lacks a audio book player.  It does not playback divx movies (sorry torrent folks :)Youtube playback: 2/10================Ok, I thought I will be able to use this to play youtube videos to entertain my daughter while driving we are driving.  I was not able to play even a single youtube video without pauses and jerks, made several attempts and finally gave up.Read on the forums and some suggested me to use the desktop version &amp; try it on wifi - But even on Wifi, while it is better than 2g/3g - it is still disgusting playback speed.I was very disappointed with this whole youtube playback partYahoo/Gmail access : 3/10==================Imagine that you open a mail and it comes up as  new mail  &amp;lt;href image= ....&gt;This phone does not even support html emails, no images either.  Other than that, the good part is that it does a pretty good job of syncing with Gmail &amp; Yahoo and downloads the emailsKeyboard  : 7/10=========The keyboard was a bit impressive - you have 3 options - mini keyboard, full size keyboard or you can write in your handwriting.  I liked to input text with the full size keyboard as this one was the most convenient.Apps  : 2/10====Yes, there is an app store, but it the store is so poorly organized and very user unfriendly that you would end up spending hours to find the right app for you.Next the apps itself - there are some decent apps available for gaming and productivity, but if you have used any android/iPhone app - you will realize that Nokia is waaaaay to behind in the game.Touch Screen: 3/10=====================First of all this is a resistive touch screen, means you need to actually put pressure on the screen for it to work, unlike the modern day capacitive touch screen which will only need you to just touch and the screen will pick up static charges from your fingers.So the Nokia's resistive touch screen works, but it is very poor in response - you will almost always need the accompanying stylesRadio : 3/10======It does have a radio, but it will not play unless you plug in the headset which acts as a antenna.  Even after plugging in the antenna, it picks up a few strong signals, but did not pick up some of the weaker signals neither indoors, nor outdoors.GPS  ; 4/10====I have a 3 year old GPS from garmin and I thought I will throw it out after I get a Nokia.  Oh oh, big mistake.  The Nokia phone comes with a assisted GPS (means it does triangulation with satellites as well as with cell phone towers.While the phone does a good job of finding your current location, it is extremely poor in finding directions and reading out the street names and directions.  It works, but it is no where near to a regular GPS or a built in GPS like the ones in iphone/android=========== summary =============Honestly, I have never felt this frustrated with any phone in my life- when I really wanted to love this so much.Nokia - where art thou ? come down from your ivory tours and give us a good phone.  We do not want to be stuck up in the vicious circle of At&amp;t; and apple - we want unlocked phones and we do not want to see crappy phones like this from you.  Pls wake up.</td>

<td>SPOILER ALERT: this is a stupidly long review. I like to provide as much detail as possible when I write a review, because that&amp;#8217;s the sort of thing I look for in other reviews. Buying things from online retailers is great and all, but it prevents us from getting any hands-on information until we&amp;#8217;ve already shelled out our money. Detailed reviews are the best way to combat disappointment and buyers&amp;#8217; remorse. So either get some popcorn and/or a coffee, or skip to the end, or skip this review entirely &amp;#61514;  Seriously though, it&amp;#8217;s a long review. Prepare yourself.This headset is about as close to ideal as I'm probably ever going to get, at least until headsets are implanted subdermally behind the ear, or when music and communications are beamed directly into the brain or something. It has great sound, features, fit, and looks. There are a few downsides which I'll get out of the way first, and then I can get back to gushing about this thing. First, I feel that the earbud cords are maybe .5 to .75 inches too short. I wear this mainly when I&amp;#8217;m at work, underneath the collar of my polo shirt. The cords therefor have to dip down under the edge of the collar, and then make the trip back up to my ears. It's fine if I'm looking straight ahead, but if I turn my head too much it will tug on the 'outside' ear (if I look left, it tugs on my right ear and vice versa). I've gotten around this somewhat by removing the little silicone o-rings that are intended to manage the earbud cords. It releases a little more cord length so the tugging is less noticeable, but it is still there. The cords are a bit short for my taste even when wearing a t-shirt, but aren&amp;#8217;t too bad. The next downside is that the headset does not support connection to two devices at once. I get that this &amp;#8220;one device at a time&amp;#8221; thing improves the handoff between music and calls, since this is easier when both services are provided by one phone/device, but I still wish I could listen to my personal phone's music collection while being able to take calls from my work phone. Other headsets like the Sony MW600 handle this with ease. I should clarify that the Buds can be PAIRED with multiple devices, but can only be connected to one device at a time. Currently, I&amp;#8217;ve got them paired with my Android tablet and phone, my iPod, and my work iPhone. I can switch from one to another by manually disconnecting from one and connecting to another (via each device&amp;#8217;s settings), so I don&amp;#8217;t have to go through the pairing process every time I want to switch &amp;#8211; pairing the Buds is not difficult at all, but that would get annoying real quick.Now that I've got that out of the way, I can talk about the stuff I like about the Buds, which is pretty much everything. First off, let me assure you that this headset DOES support Apt-X Bluetooth connections where available. Apt-X is a Bluetooth audio codec that is designed to provide sound quality equal to a wired headset. Other Bluetooth audio connections have to compress the audio, making it sound somewhat muddled and, well, bad. This happens regardless of the quality of your source audio file. Apt-X support is most commonly available in recent Samsung (including the Galaxy S3, S4, and S5) and HTC phones (including the One and M8), but there are others out there as well. If you&amp;#8217;re interested, there is a ridiculously complete .xlsx spreadsheet available from jessebandersen dot com, but a simple Google search will also yield results. I found Jesse&amp;#8217;s page by searching for &amp;#8220;aptx enabled devices&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; it was the first result in the list. Sadly Apt-X is not supported by Apple yet, and knowing them they'll come out with some proprietary alternative to it that only works with their own headsets (they bought Beats by Dre in the last week or so, so get ready). I almost passed on the Buds because Apt-X isn't listed anywhere in the specs or reviews that I saw here on Amazon. I had to go to Motorola's site and look up the user manual to find it. I was originally going to go with the LG Tone headset line (which also supports Apt-X), but didn't like the &amp;#34;flat loop&amp;#34; design that most of them have &amp;#8211; it looks like a great fit&amp;#8230; for a robot. In my opinion the Buds are designed for a better fit on an actual human: the front of the control stalks bend gently down, following the curve of the neck/shoulders/collarbones. The majority of the headset (including the very small weight of the battery pack) rests on the base of your neck, and the control stalks rest comfortably near the collarbones. The LG Tone can't do both at the same time since it is formed in a flat circle: the stalks aren&amp;#8217;t angled relative to the neck band, and they carry all the weight of the battery so they&amp;#8217;ll fall to your collarbones while the center section will be halfway up the back of your neck (the newer ones are curved like the Buds, but are $70 more expensive). I&amp;#8217;m wearing the Buds headset right now, and can hardly feel it &amp;#8211; a great improvement over traditional &amp;#8220;earhugger&amp;#8221; Bluetooth headsets. While I&amp;#8217;m talking about fit, I should probably mention that I wear a 17.5&amp;#8221; collar, and can&amp;#8217;t stand having things touching my neck or throat. The Buds fit quite comfortably, and provide just the slightest reassuring touch on the front sides of my neck. They widest gap between the left and right control stalks measures just a hair under 5 inches.The Buds have a tidy control arrangement and are easy to navigate. Play/pause/answer/end/track-skip commands (as well as EQ settings and voice dial activation) are handled by a rocker switch on the left, and volume adjustments are handled by a rocker switch on the right. The microphone is underneath the rocker switch on the left, and the power switch is underneath the body (center section) of the headset, next to the charging port. Play/pause/answer/end is done by a single press of the forward half of the left rocker switch, which has a little bit of texture to it for identification/grip purposes. You can activate voice dialing (like Siri or Samsung&amp;#8217;s S-Voice or Google voice search) by long-pressing this same button while no music is playing. Track-skip forward is done by a single press of the back half of the same switch, and track-skip back is done by a double press. I kind of wish skip forward/back were handled by separate buttons, but it&amp;#8217;s easy enough to get used to. One thing to note about the mic being on the same stalk as the answer/end button: if you have to feel around for the end call button, the person on the other end is going to hear ALL OF IT since the microphone is right beneath it. Lots of loud rustling noises. Oops. Not enough for me to list as a full-on downside, but still... kind of annoying. They could have placed the mic on the right, which come to think of it is a whole lot less &amp;#8220;busy&amp;#8221; since it mostly only has volume control functions. Volume down is achieved by pressing the forward half of the right rocker switch, and volume up by pressing the back half. You can mute an active phonecall by pressing both portions of the volume rocker, and reject an incoming call by long-pressing either one of the volume buttons. EQ modes can be changed by a long-press of the &amp;#8220;Play/Pause&amp;#8221; switch on the left. There are 3 EQ modes, but there is no indication of which one you are in, or documentation of what the effects are supposed to be. There is a voice notification of &amp;#8220;EQ mode changed!&amp;#8221; but that&amp;#8217;s it. You&amp;#8217;re on your own to figure out exactly what that means. My best guess is that the modes are flat, treble boost, and bass boost. As a general &amp;#8220;audiophile&amp;#8221; rule, flat EQ response is best since it doesn&amp;#8217;t meddle with the sound balance and you hear it as the artist intended. I can barely tell which EQ mode is bass boost, but can&amp;#8217;t tell the difference between the other two. And if I can&amp;#8217;t tell the difference, then I guess it doesn&amp;#8217;t really matter. I&amp;#8217;d recommend switching modes while listening to your general type of music, getting to an EQ setting you like, and then never changing it again. As is obvious from the pictures and literature, the earbuds are held magnetically to the ends of the control stalks when not in use. The magnets are pretty strong, and the earbuds have yet to bounce themselves loose. In fact, they are so strong that if I remove an earbud from my ear but don&amp;#8217;t attach it to the end of the stalk, I&amp;#8217;ll eventually find that it has connected itself at some point as I&amp;#8217;ve been moving around. Needless to say, don&amp;#8217;t get any of these parts too close to any of your credit cards.As far as sound quality goes, I&amp;#8217;m really impressed. The earbuds are said to have &amp;#8220;Premium HD speakers&amp;#8221;, and whatever that truly means, they sound great and the Apt-X support really helps them shine. I should point out that the Buds will still sound great with non-Apt-X devices like Apple gadgets, and will certainly sound as good as all other Bluetooth headsets that don&amp;#8217;t support it. As long as the earbuds are seated properly (which is critical with any in-ear earbuds) bass response is nice and solid, and everything just sort of sparkles. Not saying that &amp;#8220;sparkle&amp;#8221; is added in any way, but if the music has fine detail in it then you&amp;#8217;ll hear a lot more of it. Speaking of having the earbuds seated properly, the documentation talks a bit about about &amp;#8220;micro-adjustability&amp;#8221;, and what this translates into is that the stem of each earbud can pivot a certain amount around a central axis in a sort of narrow cone shape, so the angle of the stem relative to the earbud&amp;#8217;s body can change a bit to fit different peoples&amp;#8217; ear structures. The earbuds seem to stay fairly well seated unless I get really sweaty. Speaking of sweat, I will also note that the Buds are not labelled as &amp;#8220;sweat proof&amp;#8221;, which does make me worry a little bit. I sweat easily, and do a lot of biking and walking, and my work is somewhat physical too. Hopefully this does not become an issue. There is a little rubber plug you have to partially remove to access the charging port, so make sure you place it back securely before getting sweaty. Anyways, back to audio quality: One important thing to note, which is true of all high quality sound delivery devices, is that the final output depends highly on good source material. You should know by now that low quality sources like 128Kbps .mp3 files or even some tracks on Pandora and other streaming services aren&amp;#8217;t the best, and with these you will hear every little bit of their badness. Other headsets may mask this but they&amp;#8217;re also masking the fine detail of better quality files, so in a way it&amp;#8217;s actually a good thing. Call quality on both ends of the line is really good as well, and I&amp;#8217;ve never had anyone ask &amp;#8220;Are you using Bluetooth?&amp;#8221; which I usually get when I use other headsets. In fact, I had one person stop me in mid-conversation and ask &amp;#8220;Didn&amp;#8217;t you say you were going to put on your bluetooth headset?&amp;#8221;, and almost didn&amp;#8217;t believe me when I said I already had. One last thing about audio quality &amp;#8211; if you listen to music via any app with preamp gain, you may want to be reduce that gain level to zero. I use PowerAmp on my Galaxy S4 and was dismayed at first to hear a ton of distortion, especially in the low end. I almost returned the headset because I could not get rid of it. I eventually found that the preamp gain (on PowerAmp&amp;#8217;s EQ settings page) was set to about 75% of its capacity, and turning it down eliminated the distortion completely. You can get rid of the distortion at 25%, but why risk it? I keep it at zero now just to be sure. Doing so also reduced the overall volume, but since these things get plenty loud on their own, I don&amp;#8217;t mind at all.Usually I hate the looks of most Bluetooth headsets: the obnoxious blinking blue lights and the giant blobs of techno-crud clamped to peoples&amp;#8217; ears make them look like extras from bad 80&amp;#8217;s sci-fi movies. I have to say that the Motorola Buds practically disappear, especially while wearing them under the collar of a polo shirt. They do have an indicator light, but it is nestled in between the power switch and charging port, so it&amp;#8217;s not visible at all while they&amp;#8217;re being worn. I have to say, at first I wasn&amp;#8217;t too pleased with the fact that even the black headset has white bits on it (the undersides of the flat cords, the silicone ear pieces, and the forward/inside halves of the earbud shells). I have changed my mind and have very much come to enjoy the subtle high-contrast design. It looks nice and modern without looking like it&amp;#8217;s trying too hard. As I said, it practically disappears under a polo collar &amp;#8211; all you can see is the white silicone ear pieces and a touch of the white from the cord. When you&amp;#8217;ve got an earbud inserted, the white flash from the undersides of the cords help make it a little more obvious to others that you&amp;#8217;re either listening to music or talking on the phone. I say &amp;#8220;a little&amp;#8221; because people still give me weird looks when they walk into a room while I&amp;#8217;m in mid conversation. I have to make the universal &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m not a lunatic, I&amp;#8217;m just on the phone&amp;#8221; gesture to most folks, but the observant ones can figure it out for themselves more easily. I see these now come in blue, which makes me even more sad that they don&amp;#8217;t come in red. You see, I have a sickness. A sickness which has yet to be defined (or even acknowledged) by Science, in which I have an overwhelming love (some, like my wife, would say &amp;#8220;unhealthy obsession&amp;#8221;) for black things with red trim, or red things with black trim, or&amp;#8230;  well, you get the idea. If these came in red, I&amp;#8217;d sell 4 of my 5 pints of blood (or at least my black/white Buds) to get a set. Maybe one day.Those are the main points I wanted to talk about. There are a few more things that don&amp;#8217;t really fit in the review elsewhere, so I&amp;#8217;ll stick them here. The specs say that the wireless range is up to 150 feet, but that is with a &amp;#8220;Class 1 Bluetooth device&amp;#8221;, which your phone probably isn&amp;#8217;t. Realistic use is still around 30 to 40 feet, with minor barriers like walls and doors. I don&amp;#8217;t even know where to find a true Class 1 Bluetooth device, so get that 150ft range spec out of your head. Battery life seems to be pretty good, and although I try to charge the headset every night, I&amp;#8217;ve gone as far as 2 full workdays of mixed usage without running out of battery. They&amp;#8217;re rated at &amp;#8220;up to 12 hours&amp;#8221; of playback, but it&amp;#8217;s anyone&amp;#8217;s guess as to what that actually means. I talked about the silicone earpieces earlier, but forgot to mention that they come in 3 sizes &amp;#8211; small, medium, and large. The Buds come with the small ones installed already, but I found that the mediums were best for me. The earpieces on most of my other earbuds (both wired and wireless) are 99% interchangeable, but these are slightly different. The posts on the ear stems are a slightly smaller diameter than standard, so earpieces from other sets are a bit loose. Swapping other earpieces to the Buds would result in more sound leakage and result in poorer sound quality and bass response, and also put you at a much higher risk of having one of the earpieces coming off the stem and sticking in your ear. Trust me, you don&amp;#8217;t want that. Stick to the 3 sizes provided and find the one that best suits you. Use the biggest size you can stand, because a good seal is critical for good sound quality. Another thing I mentioned briefly was the Buds&amp;#8217; voice notifications. The Buds have a set of pre-programmed voice notifications built in that you&amp;#8217;ll hear as you turn the headset on and off, or change EQ settings, and maybe a few other commands. When you power it up, the headset plays a short musical tune and then a chipper female voice says &amp;#8220;Welcome to the Motorola Buds!&amp;#8221; When you connect to a phone or mp3 player, the same voice says &amp;#8220;Device 1 connected!&amp;#8221; The voice isn&amp;#8217;t too bad, but it took me a while to get used to. When you receive a phone call, it will play another tune at you instead of mirroring your phone&amp;#8217;s ringtone. I think it&amp;#8217;s a riff on the first few notes of &amp;#8220;Ride of the Valkyries&amp;#8221; but I could be wrong. The Buds also play a soft &amp;#8220;bloop&amp;#8221; noise every time you play or pause or adjust the volume. Other than these &amp;#8220;bloop&amp;#8221; noises, there is really no indication of whether or not the unit is even powered up. I mention this because if the headset loses connection it will automatically power down after 5 minutes to save battery. If you pick the headset up after a while and don&amp;#8217;t know what power state it&amp;#8217;s in, hit a volume button and listen for the bloop. The headset has yet to drop Bluetooth connection on its own, which is a first for all the headsets I&amp;#8217;ve owned and is kind of impressive. The very last thing I wanted to talk about (yeah, I made a list) is that there are very thin rubber strips that run up the undersides of each control stalk, which I think serve the purpose of covering the track the wires run through. A small section of one of these strips popped up after about a week and would not seat itself back down. I eventually decided that they are probably held in place by some sort of adhesive, since I could not get it to &amp;#8220;pop back in&amp;#8221;, so I placed the tiniest dab of Krazy Glue in there, wiped off the excess, and held it in place until it dried. This was about a month ago, and it has not popped back up yet.So that&amp;#8217;s absolutely every observation about the Motorola Buds that I&amp;#8217;ve made since I got them. If you&amp;#8217;ve read through all that, I salute you. I probably owe you 20 minutes of your life back. Sorry about that. Now on to the summary, which I promised at the start:For the tl;dr crowd, I wholly approve of this headset. It&amp;#8217;s the headset I&amp;#8217;ve been waiting quite some time for, and it&amp;#8217;s finally here. Features, fit, sound, and looks are all pretty much perfect, and it&amp;#8217;s hard to come up with a list of serious disadvantages. As I write this, it&amp;#8217;s available here for $58, which is quite a steal. The nearest competitor is the LG HBS-800, which normally goes for $130. Check these out &amp;#8211; I don&amp;#8217;t think you&amp;#8217;ll be disappointed.</td>

<td>SummaryThe Nokia N96 is an expensive phone that competes against many rival companies that have done their homework over the years to provide competitive products against this phone-dominating firm. The N96 fails to be able to be a leader in its phone class, with issues that are problematic of a phone years older.  The few positives of the N96 do not command the high purchase price.Background:I used the N96 with AT&amp;T; service in the US.  My local areas has extensive 3G coverage so I was always able to get a solid 3G, fast, connection (Note I do not have any LiveTV service in my area).  My normal phones I use are the Iphone 3G and the Samsung Blackjack II (windows mobile).  I am a rather geeky person who enjoys tinkering with phones and computers so I will provide an assessment from a user-experience in comparison to the two phones I've cited, which I use often on the same 3G service; for those who aren't aware, GSM phones have sim cards that can be popped into different phones so aren't &quot;tied&quot; to a specific piece of hardware (i.e. Verizon, Sprint).Unboxing:The N96 comes in a very nice retail box.  This is typical of Nokia's products, placing a high degree of emphasis on packaging.  It sets off a nice first impression of the product.Build:Overall the phone has a mirrored surface for its LCD and a shiny black glossy surface for the rest of the phone.  The black does attract fingerprints and at first this tends to put people off.  However, after a while the fingerprint effect psychologically diminishes upon itself so you do not really care.The keys are only average in tactile feel and comparable to a regular $200 phone.  This is surprising since I thought a top of the line phone would have quality keys with a firm solid response.  Not so here.  The keys spacing are not conducive to one-hand dialing without looking at the unit.The LCD is beautiful, with crisp text and accurate color display. If there's anything that's very well engineered on this phone it will be the LCD and camera (more on that below).  Truly world-class, I haven't quite seen an LCD look as good as on this phone.The camera is really good on this phone. Quite a far cry from the iphone and other Windows mobile phones.  Pictures come out reasonably sharp in daylight.  Low light is poor, but again, that's nothing unusual from any camera phone and the quality is still leaps and bounds better than the iphone. The camera does have a very bright LED that can amazingly light up a dead-dark environment a few feet ahead at max range.The exterior speaker is loud enough but only average in quality with a slightly tinny output.  I believe that my blackjack II's speaker is louder and cleaner in output, not significantly so, but enough to be noticeable.The rear kickstand, a widely marketed feature, is a pure gimmick that is poorly designed. Because it is not directly in the middle of the unit, the weight is not properly balanced. This means that an uneven surface, or a slight breeze could topple the unit over.  Tacky, I was so full of disgust when I tried it myself.  Needs to be completely reengineered or gotten rid of entirely.The ports are that of a micro USB, headphone, and power port. Nokia has decided not to use the USB port for power, however, so you have to lug around the power plug during travel if you take your laptop with you.  Not cool!There are no rubber boots for the ports on the phone.  Not a good sign - -water seepage can end up being a problem here.  And for those who say those boots tear off anyway, that is not necessarily true.  My old Blackjack II phone never had any of its boots torn off even though I heavily &quot;abused&quot; it for a year by inserting an removing countless times.Battery life is mediocre.  I could get about a day's worth of use with heavy web browsing and a few phone calls.  The battery gets much hotter than a normal smartphone does when in heavy discharge/charge mode.  It would be nice if Nokia could address this issue by producing a phone that doesn't feel like a mini hot plate to your face or hand.Accessories:The included car charger is a strange size.  It could not fit into my cig lighter.  Fortunately, I had a car charger from a different Nokia model that was compatible.  There is a proper USB cable included, which is a good thing since not everyone has a microUSB ported type of cable.  The travel charger is small enough.  There is no MicroSD card included, but these are cheap enough to buy for anyone who needs more than the regular 16GB of built in memory.  It's really nice that the memory is expandable like this, compared to the iphone where you are locked out from expansion options.  For music lovers, this means you can have a max of 24GB of memory and 16GB microsd's are on there way over soon, so that would mean 32gb of storage.  Not bad!Interface and response:The user interface is typical Nokia sybian.  That is, the menu set is fairly straight forward in operation.  The phone, however, has a sluggish feel to it.  Programs load sluggishly, making you wonder if you pressed the right button to launch it.  After a bit, the lag finally catches up.  I expect such typical behavior from a Windows Mobile phone,but the fact a Symbian phone does this is clearly unacceptable.  I'm not sure why the phone is so slow in execution; supposedly this phone lacks a multimedia processor and is clocked very low.  Regardless, it simply is slow, and that's all that matters to the end-user who will feel upset waiting at the response times.  This issue likely extends into the browser.The built-in web browser is much better than IE for windows mobile.  However, it is much worse than the Iphone's browser.  Pages render fairly well but loading is slow and scrolling stutters.  Although the phone was capable of launching youtube videos from the regular youtube site, there was so much stuttering going on that it was useless. Resource intensive sites like CNN are too slow to load, making it painful to view.  Zooming was horrible and nonintuitive. Again, this was a common issue on old phones from the early 2000s, but a top of the line phone for 2009?  The Iphone, by comparison, breezes through the most intense sites with ease.  This is sadly not a good web browsing phone. Since a 3G data plan with AT&amp;T; is so expensive, some of us would like a phone that's capable of browsing like an Iphone does.  Can't do that here.The phone does not support an international character set out of the box.  If you want to to view Chinese, for example, you cannot do this unless you mail in your phone to a Nokia service center.  This is a ludicrous option (did we timewarp to 1999?) in a time when extras should be downloadable from the manufacturer, even for a fee.  Since there's only one Nokia service center in the entire USA, you have to wait a long time for the turnaround.  To go without a phone that long is unacceptable.  The Iphone, by comparison, supports International characters right out of the box!The java stack on the N96 is awful.  It's too sensitive to security prohibitions and runs sluggishly, again.  I tried running Opera Mini, a java app, and it kept giving me security warnings every time I launched it, with no way to bypass those warnings.  The Opera mini program ran much slower than on my Blackjack II, a reflection, again, on the slow processing speed of the N96.The included GPS program was incredibly slow (do I hear an echo?) compared to the free Google Maps I've used on the iphone and the Blackjack.  Scrolling just to browse a map was painful and not something I could have any fun with.  In contrast, I love being able to just browse the maps on my other phones because it's quick and efficient.The N96 does have an auto position that uses the accelerometer.  It does work (disabled by default) but not all Symbian programs support it.  Therefore you are left with a rather quirky feature that may not activate when you expect it to.The T9 system is fast and pretty accurate. Honestly it's not going to get any better than this for input with a numeric keypad. The next step is have some hard alpha keys or an onscreen keyboard.As for phone quality, it sounded pretty good on both ends. Then again ,a 3G connection provides the crisp quality so the network infrastructure is more to the reason here.Conclusion:Nokia's N96 feels like a step back into time. It is sluggish in response, has poor included utilities, and its construction is not as good compared to its main rivals -- The iphone and the various Windows mobile platform phones.  The high price is not commensurate with its ability.  In particular, web browsing is awful.  A complete redesign is needed to make this phone faster and more intuitive.</td>

<td>I was excited to try this phone out as I have been using Windows Mobile devices for awhile (currently using the AT&amp;T; Tilt) and never been completely satisfied with their performance. A 16 gig phone geared for music and video looked right up my alley. Having used this phone for several days and tried as many features as possible, I'm not nearly as enamored with it as I hoped. For a $600 phone, I expected something far more polished. This seems to have been rushed into production and has quite a few bugs and problems. Let's run down the good stuff first.PROS:- Light, compact form factor. Considerably lighter than my Tilt.- 16 gig of memory. Excellent amount of included space, and can take a microSD card for even more media files.- Beautiful screen. Video is sharp and colorful, although it could be a bit brighter. But hard to complain with the quality of the picture. See below though for more comments on video playback. It also is much more visible in sunlight than my Tilt is.- 5 gig camera with flash and video capability. I debated whether to include this under the &quot;pros&quot; as I didn't find the quality of the images produced by the camera all that great, particularly indoors. But having a flash and being able to record video with it is still at least better than not having it at all.- Excellent sound quality and nice loud speakers. Includes two speakers for &quot;sort-of&quot; stereo playback. This phone can really produce some serious volume, I was quite impressed. Granted, the sound quality out of the speakers is not going to blow anyone away. But it's pretty good regardless. And make sure you turn the volume down before using the headphones, it will totally blast you away! If you regularly try to listen to music in noisy situations where volume is crucial, you will know how important this can be.- Excellent multimedia features included. FM radio, internet radio, podcasts, etc. Most of these I could do on my WM phone, but great to have them included for seamless integration right on the phone.- Good included accessories. Includes a remote with speakerphone, car charger, TV out cables, free game, etc. Better package overall than most phones.Now for my fairly long list of negatives.CONS:- Lack of fullsize keyboard and/or touchscreen. I was surprised to see there was no touchscreen on this phone, that makes it really hard to compete with other smartphones in the same class like the iPhone and any Windows Mobile phone. With my Tilt, I not only have a full QWERTY keyboard (which granted, is not the greatest way to enter text for most people, but nice for things like passwords and WEP keys) you can use a wide variety of entry methods that work with the touchscreen. I personally use ones like Fitaly and Touchpad which can give good speed and yet still easily handle non-standard text at any time. One of the things I particularly find annoying with phones like this that use T9 is that you often have to turn it on and off which requires going to the menu. Likewise with the multi-key entry of letters and numbers, you have to constantly switch back and forth, which takes far longer on this phone than just about any other smartphone I've used. It's incredibly tedious and if you use your phone as a PDA or anything other than quick texting, you should probably look at better options.- Problems using Wifi versus AT&amp;T; data plans. I personally use pay-as-you-go currently as I don't need to pay for monthly cell phone service and almost always have access to Wifi networks. With my Tilt, it's a simple matter of a one-time configuration of the phone for any Wifi network and it will use that automatically versus accessing the AT&amp;T; data network. This phone just would not cooperate with that. It often would switch over and use the data plan and charge me no matter how I configured it, even going into the settings and making my Wifi the default. Worse, you would have to do this *every* time you access a new Wifi network, setting it up as a default and then switching it back, and even then, it seems to randomly hit the data network and charge me for usage without warning. And to make it even more annoying, just about every time it needs to access the internet, it has to ask me what network to use, the Wifi or AT&amp;T.; Why bother setting a default (and configuring it for automatic) if it's not going to just use it?? It's almost like the phone is trying to get you to use the paid data plan whether you have access to Wifi or not. Just about everything else on this phone I can kind of deal with, or work around, but this is so frustrating for me and COSTS ME MONEY that it's a total dealbreaker. So if you want to use Wifi as your primary data access network, and not pay the significant cost of a monthly data plan, you will probably want to use a different phone.- Bare-bones email and web applications. The email and web apps that came with the phone didn't do much for me. Emails with HTML were not properly formatted at all, and the options for handling email as well were very limited compared to what I am used to. When I tried to adjust my settings, it wiped out my custom POP settings and I had to enter them all over again (which due to the lack of keyboard is particularly annoying). The web browser was not quite as bad, but navigating the pages without a touchscreen is slow and tedious and it kept popping up the &quot;overall&quot; page view when it was inconvenient. The back button brings up little thumbnails of the pages but for some reason they were often blank and kept skipping the actual page I wanted to get back to. I was easily able to load on the free Opera Mini browser however, which gave me a far better experience. If you use a smartphone, I highly recommend grabbing a copy of it. I've not yet found a free email replacement, I'd probably have to pay to get an email application that just does the basics that I would have liked to come with the device.- While there's certainly plenty of games on Symbian and for N-Gage, the library of applications is a bit more limited. Also just the fact that it doesn't use a touchscreen makes game play often more limiting and somewhat more tedious as it relies totally on keystrokes, particularly the types of games I prefer (card games, adventure games, etc.) Still, the games offered were decent enough and the graphics top-notch for a mobile phone, and I do notice more places offering Symbian versions of their software. Both my Hava player and Roboform mobile apps had versions that ran okay on the N96 (although not flawless).- Performance issues. My main hope was that this device would be zippier and less prone to locking up than the Tilt. Unfortunately this was not the case. The processor is downgraded from the previous N95 model, most likely done to allow them to also downgrade the battery as well but I can't say if the problems I saw are a result of this or typical for Symbian phones. While the video was sharp and beautiful to look at, I still experienced pauses and skips...particularly with the sample videos included! Almost all of the ones included with the phone did not play smoothly all the way through. I had better luck with some small videos that I synced to the device and a couple TV episodes that I downloaded from Amazon Unbox. While they did not always play perfectly, they were at least watchable for 95% of the time. The phone itself also often temporarily pauses and/or freezes and a few times locked up on me completely. Unlike the Tilt which has a reset option, I could not figure out how to unlock this phone when it froze other than to remove the back and pull the battery out. Very annoying.- Camera image quality. It's important when evaluating cameras to realize that megapixels means little about quality. So getting 5 MP with the phone means mostly that the images it takes will just take up more space on the phone. They certainly aren't of a quality that I would be interested in printing them out which is where the 5 MP would be of any use. They are of similar quality to most cellphones...which means only good for snapshots when you have nothing better on-hand. And indoors in anything other than very bright light, they were definitely worse than what my Tilt is able to take, even though the camera includes a flash.- Battery life. Barely passable, no better than my Tilt which was equally a battery hog. You definitely need to charge it every night and if you use your phone much, you may find you need to charge it during the day as well.- Voice control. This is one of those phones that you don't really train, it just recognizes the names you speak and picks the default phone. Also some basic application control. This type of VR can be problematic if you have people with similar names and I just much prefer training my own names and commands as I can with the software on WM phones. And of course, there's nothing in the manual about how to even use this feature.- Live TV. Touted as a feature, but won't work for most people due to very limited coverage right now. You're probably much better off just getting a Slingbox or Hava which will work with a wide range of phones these days, including this one.- Non-standard USB cable. May seem like a small nit, but things like this just annoy me. Why not use a standard mini-USB cable, which most people have multiple ones of, and also a USB cable that will simultaneous charge the device? It's really annoying when you are syncing the device, moving videos, etc. and it runs out of juice. Using this new micro USB cable means I'll need to buy another one for travel....and probably another cable for charging in different places.- GPS. I only tested the GPS briefly as this was another area where it seemed to insist on using the data plan rather than Wifi. But I just don't see the benefit in using a GPS on such a small screen and paying monthly fees for it, when you can buy dedicated GPS units for as little as $100 these days that are larger and easier to read while driving, and with much better features. This GPS didn't work nearly as well as my simple Garmin unit and didn't even compare with running TomTom on my Tilt which I don't pay any fee to use (other than the purchase cost of the software).- No case or screen protector. For the price, some kind of cheap case would be nice. The device comes with a plastic skin covering the front and back that would do nicely as a screen protector, but for some reason, they plastered a big &quot;NOKIA&quot; over the front so it can't be used. The screen and phone itself really shows fingerprints and smudges pretty readily so a screen protector would have been highly appreciated.- Nokia PC Suite issues. I didn't have too much trouble syncing my Outlook contacts, but had various issues with other parts of the PC Suite. Forget using the music application, for some reason it didn't read 99% of the tags in my MP3s, so had to use Media Player to sync music to the device. The video manager as well did not work very well for me. It handled small videos okay, but as soon as it got to anything with length, it locked up on me. Took me several tries to convert videos of more than 100 meg in size. I want to try and do some conversions myself and see what videos it really can handle, as I have other mobile video conversion software that does a good job, but I know already it doesn't seem to handle Divx video which is a shame.- Bare bones user manual. The manuals included cover the basics, but you won't find much help in them if you need more than just &quot;getting started&quot; information. For instance, I was trying to figure out where I turn on T9 predictive text, but there's absolutely no information in the manual on text entry whatsoever. I went to the Nokia site to see if the support section had a better manual to download, but nope. You better be good at figuring stuff out on your own to use this phone (and yes, I did figure out where the T9 setting was).- Other issues. I seem to just run into random problems with this phone. YouTube videos for instance would not play at all, regardless of which browser I used. It doesn't seem to like most of my album art in the music player, and does not always play smoothly if playing in the background while doing other activities on the phone (web browsing for instance). The microSD slot is harder than most to get the card in and out of. The build quality is very plastic, cheap feeling. And there are just some things that make it obvious it was kind of rushed to market. For instance, there's a settings screen for a &quot;scroll wheel&quot; even though the phone doesn't even have one! Would be nice if it did, but to have settings in there for something that does not even exist on it, makes me wonder how much testing they really gave this phone before releasing.To summarize, this is a phone I really wanted to like. It's got huge potential as a portable media device and phone, but there are just too many problem areas to recommend it over other devices in the same price range.</td>

<td>When I am buying a Plantronics brand - there are a few things that I can expect:- Excellent sound quality- Sturdy build- Good quality headphonesThis phone does live by all the expectations, but yet when it comes to making a cordless phone - Plantronics engineers and designers need to work on it a bit more.  Here is why, let me go through the good stuff and then the not so good stuff.The good=========+ Excellent sound quality - I've been using this for the last 3 weeks, never had call drops+ Light weight, compared to my Panasonic, this feels like feather+ Battery life that never seems to die - I have used it for almost upto 10 hours of talk time and all this in a tiny battery that fits inside !!+ Sturdy build - you can feel that the phone is sturdy, I accidentally dropped it on hard kitchen floor from 5 feet and it has survived without any damage.  My Panasonic would have given up, if not atleast the battery flaps would have come off+ Ergonomics - nice to hold, clip on to the belt (i usually keep it in my pocket)+ Good range - The wirless signals pretty strong, I could walk across the street and still be able to talk.  And unlike my panasonic - never did this phone fail to obtain a base connection within a reasonable range+ None/low interference with wireless networkThe bad=========If there is one big item that needs to improve in this phone - it is the user interface.  Plantronics really needs to make the phone a bit more friendlier to use.  But I also understand that Plantronics had to optimize on the space to make it smaller, but there are things which they can definitely improve on.- Difficult to nagivate/non-intuitive menu options- Not so friendly messages Example : '3 new CID' means '3 missed calls' !!!- Headset is great in sound, but not so good in the fit - I personally do not like the over the ear clip on head phones - why do not plantronics provide something simple like the one which iphone or blackberry provides.  Plantronics these cute bluetooth headphones (I have one) which are so small and nice - why did they not think of something like that.  Right now, I am using my blackberry headset which is simple and easy to use and carry and not look like a call center operator- Keys do not give a nice touch.  Keys are good, clear and sturdy, but you need to have the feel of clicking something with confidence, not a cushy rubber mat kind of feeling- No backlighting for keys - makes it hard sometimes to see in the dark- Lack of smart redialing - This applies to most of us who work from home offices: If you get on to a conference call, you typically dial a 1-800 number and then type in the conference id and passwordNow, when you hang up and redial - you just want only the 1800 number to be dialed, not the conference call id.  Most cell phones are smart enough to separate out the call number and redial, but this one is not equipped to redial just the phone number.Wish List=========- Wish it came with a speakerphone :)Value=========- Plantronics devices literally last for ever, I have used them in the past and they are so sturdy and well built that they will last atleast 10 years or more.But if you are looking at immediate value - the current price of $89 seems to be on the higher sideOverall - this is a great investment in a device which you will be using on a daily basis.  Work from home, small business owners or just anyone else who needs to be on a phone while working will need this - with the kind of battery life that this device packs - you could literally talk the entire work day  and never worry about recharging</td>

<td>I was very dissapointed with its audio performance. I don't want to write a lot because others have definitely written the positive features in good detail(good microphone, quick connect, good battery life, light-weight etc.), but the usability is very restricted.Here is the bottom line, if you want to take this unit outside of your office/home/any quiet environment, you will NOT be able to hear the other person even if the environment is moderately noisy (this is at unit's highest volume). I was using this in the car, and I can hear faint at best when the road is good, but when you pass through slightly patchy freeway, the other person's voice is completely drowned. The speaker's maximum volume is just completely unacceptable. By the way, this experience was inside a luxury car, not a cardboard car. I am not sure the reason behind this design, could be to improve battery life?I had high expectations. I am returning this unit to Amazon and will look at the Jabra BT500 (read good reviews about it: in-ear position &amp; USB charging).By the way, I used this with my Blackberry 7100g, good syncing and quick connection.</td>
