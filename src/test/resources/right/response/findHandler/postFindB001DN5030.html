<td>The new Nokia N96 phone reads like a powerhouse smartphone packed with features. It is a full color, unlocked GSM slider phone with a 5MP camera, stereo sound, music and video features. While it is a quad band world phone, here in the US it works on T-Moblie and AT&amp;T; networks (although AT&amp;T; is recommened for its faster 3G network). Let me start out by describing what you get. Nokia has packed quite a bit in the box. They include cables to hook your phone up to you TV to watch video, a car charger, a sync cable to sync your phone to your pc for updates, video, app and music downloads, battery, travel charger, a remote that hooks into the phone along with earbuds that hook into the remote, (no you can't use the earbuds without the remote and you cannot hook alternate headsets into the phone or the remote),an invitation to use the OVI service (an online backup service with tiered features to backup your phone), a User Guide, Get Started Guide, the Nokia PC Suite CD, an NGage free game offer, warranty info and of course the phone.Now for the phone. It is a beautiful, full color, lightweight device that promises much, but delivers less. Since this is a GSM phone, after calling to switch service, you only need to add your SIM card to start using it. The battery was partially charged out of the box, so it did not take long to charge. Despite what I have read from other reviews, I had no problems adding contacts from my SIM card to the phone. Since this phone IS NOT a touch screen, everything is menu driven. Nokia did not do a good job of letting you know where all the menus are. While a User Guide is included, the full version of how to use the phone is included in the online version of the guide that can be found at the Nokia product page. The buttons on this phone do not stand out as much as I would like. The call and end keys are on opposite sides, but are not as prominent as they should be. The Power key is on top and it takes a few minutes to turn it on. There are &quot;media keys&quot; that work for video or music playback that surround the larger scroll key. The scroll key is used to navigate the various menus, with the usual Nokia context sensitive Selection keys above the Call and End keys. The scroll key is very sensitive, I kept hitting selections that I did not want and it is also used for navigating web pages. There is a menu key that is usefull and a multimedia key which isn't that helpful. The display is beautiful and call quality is excellent. You slide the main section up to bring up the keyboard and number pad. This phone should have had a qwerty keyboard, as the typing on the keypad is time consuming pressing keys until you come to the one yo need.  This is also even more frustrating for the Internet. While the display is very clear, the browser is only a WAP mobile browser, not the full Internet browser that an iPhone or iPod Touch would have. Using the scroll key to move a too small arrow around is a pain. While this phone offers YouTube, the Internet video quality is very spotty. The stereo sound in 3D is very clear and you do not need a headset to listen. This phone is one of the few compatible with the Amazon UnBox service. To try out the service, I installed the Nokia PC suite. It installled a software updater, Video suite manager, photo app, PC suite app, and a Map loader for the GPS function. The installation of the apps was fast, though starting the PC Suite app took a very long time. The Amazon UnBox service is a video on demand portable player to watch video on you PC or mobile device. It was very easy to download the player and install it. Amazon has a nice selection of videos and I downloaded a Stargate SG-1 episode to view on my phone. Purchasing was fast and easy although downloading took a very long time because of the extra option for portable files. The UnBox player interface is nice, but I had a difficult time trying to transfer the files to the phone. The help files say that you can just copy files to the phone, but you actually transfer the files by clicking play. After finally getting the files to transfer to the phone, I was able to watch the video. The video playback on the phone for the Amazon purchase was clear and of excellent quality. Playback on the phone is in the widescreen format. It will play in both portrait and landscape mode, although queing up takes a while unlike an iPod or iPhone. You can slide the main phone the other way to show the video keys in landscape mode. The main 5MP camera with the Carl Zeiss lens is outstanding, the best camera I have seen on a phone so far. It has a flash and is located on the back. There is also a lower resolution camera on the front. Both can capture images and video. Photos look fantastic. The N96 is also supposed to broadcast TV signals through the LIVE TV service, but like most of the Nokia service options, it is not available in the US. Neither is the Nokia Music Store and the Nokia Maps turn by turn service. The phone will play music via the Windows Media Player (no Apple iTunes formats) and podcasts. It also has an FM radio and Internet radio playback capability. The radio feature will only play with the remote and headset attached. You cannot listen to the radio without the attachments, another boneheaded manuever by Nokia. The Maps feature, which is the GPS function to me was useless. After the app opens, you see a 3D image of the planet. You have to install the Maps software before the actual street level option will work and as I mentioned before, the turn by turn doesn't work in the US. My iPod Touch handles GPS faster and easier than this. The N96 is also supposed to be Bluetooth compatible, but I could not get it to discover my Bluetooth headset despite numerous attempts.This phone has a lot of quirks. While it does turn on fairly quickly and you can make calls quickly, Using many of the features means responding to a number of silly requests such as &quot;go on Internet now?&quot; after selecting the web option. I personally prefer touch screen phones because it is much easier to navigate than having to drill down through numerous menus. Some shortcut options are available, but not for a lot of features. I did not try the OVI service, since I already use a wonderful service called Dashwire to backup my phone. The N96 does have a large 16 GB storage with a memory card addition available, it does leave a lot to be desired. This phone is better engineered for the overseas market rather than the US. It would a good option for those who use the Windows Media audio files for music and radio and camera and video fans. It is a good effort, but falls short, especially for the high price.</td>

<td>The N96 is a dual slider phone -push up and the keypad is revealed, down and the media keys are revealed.  The phone feels solid, and the slider mechanism is sturdy and clicks into position nicely.  An accelerometer automatically switches the display orientation when you rotate the phone.  A car charger is included in the box, which is nice.The N96 has Wi-Fi b/g, A-GPS, stereo Bluetooth, and AT&amp;T; 3G coverage (it does not support T-Mobile's 3G band, but can be used with T-Mobile's regular network).  Call quality is good, and the speakerphone is loud.For productivity the phone has a robust phonebook and calendar.  Moreover, the phonebook allows for endless customization of the information contained in a contact.  There are programs to open Microsoft Office documents and PDF files.  The phone can also access POP3 e-mail, and be set to download new messages automatically.For entertainment there is a video player, FM radio, and an MP3 player.  The video works well with Amazon's Unbox Video on Demand service.  You can download special smaller files just for use on the phone, and it's easy to transfer them over using Amazon's free software download.  The music player is nicely featured, sounds good, and has a 3.5mm headphone jack making it easy to use your favorite headphones.The HTML web browser lets you view web pages like you would on a computer.  (I downloaded Skyfire, a free browser, as an alternate because sometimes the standard browser does not display pages well). N-Gage is for playing and downloading games, and Nokia maps comes pre-loaded with US maps and three months of turn-by-turn directions free.  Additionally, the GPS receiver locks onto a signal quickly.Being a Nokia N-Series the built in camera is 5 megapixels, with a dual LED flash, and autofocus with an assist light.  Photos are comparable to an entry-level compact camera, and using the GPS you can geotag your photos and view them on the map.  Video can be recorded at 640 x 480 at 30fps, much higher quality than most phones.To store your files there's a huge 16GBs of built in memory, as well as a Micro SD slot for more space when needed.The &quot;profiles&quot; feature allows you to set different ringer volumes and tones for different occasions, and you can time them so it reverts to the standard profile.  This is a great feature as it allows me to set my phone to work mode and it automatically switches back to normal mode at 5:30 when I leave.  Additionally, you can have the N96 say the callers name when it rings.  The &quot;destinations&quot; feature lets you select access points for Internet usage.  Since I have pay per use with AT&amp;T;, I removed AT&amp;T; from the list so I never have to worry about unexpected charges, and I added my home and work Wi-Fi so it automatically connects to them.I have not used the software that came with the phone since it does not work with Macs.  However, I downloaded a plug-in from Nokia's website that allows me to sync with my Mac over Bluetooth using the Mac's iSync, and it works great.Battery life is about 4 days with moderate use (a few calls, some texting, and web browsing).Now for the negatives: 1) The biggest problem, by far, is that sometimes the phone does not ring with the ringer I picked, it reverts to the default Nokia tune after one ring.  I called Nokia about it twice, and tried their suggestions, but it still happened.  They told me to send the phone to them for repair.  I declined and decided to live with it.  I also reset the phone to no avail.  2) The phone can sometimes be slow in operation.  Specifically, when opening the camera and browsing the photo gallery.  3) The dual LED flash is not very effective, you have to be right on top of the subject, and the pictures come out bluish.  Additionally, there is no sliding cover for the lens, and the camera button is stiff and hard to press.  4) For the price, the materials should be of higher quality, it's constructed of average feeling plastics.  5) The included owners manual is skimpy and barely covers all the phones features.  6) The battery depletes very quickly after 3 bars are left.(Sorry for the long review, but it's a very complex phone.)All in all... a feature packed mini computer that happens to be a phone, it lives up to the Nokia N Series tradition.01/15/09 Update: The phone has been reseting sometimes when I get a call and it has not been working well with my Acura's bluetooth HandsFreeLink I can only make calls by dialing on the phone then transferring it over.  If I could, I would take a star away.01/27/09 Update: I got a new SIM card (mine was 2 years old) and just downloaded the new software version 12.043 and the phone runs faster and the ringer and reset issues seem to be fixed.  So I'd give it a star back.03/24/09 Update: Phone still working well, slider still nice and tight and locks into position nicely.</td>

<td>SummaryThe Nokia N96 is an expensive phone that competes against many rival companies that have done their homework over the years to provide competitive products against this phone-dominating firm. The N96 fails to be able to be a leader in its phone class, with issues that are problematic of a phone years older.  The few positives of the N96 do not command the high purchase price.Background:I used the N96 with AT&amp;T; service in the US.  My local areas has extensive 3G coverage so I was always able to get a solid 3G, fast, connection (Note I do not have any LiveTV service in my area).  My normal phones I use are the Iphone 3G and the Samsung Blackjack II (windows mobile).  I am a rather geeky person who enjoys tinkering with phones and computers so I will provide an assessment from a user-experience in comparison to the two phones I've cited, which I use often on the same 3G service; for those who aren't aware, GSM phones have sim cards that can be popped into different phones so aren't &quot;tied&quot; to a specific piece of hardware (i.e. Verizon, Sprint).Unboxing:The N96 comes in a very nice retail box.  This is typical of Nokia's products, placing a high degree of emphasis on packaging.  It sets off a nice first impression of the product.Build:Overall the phone has a mirrored surface for its LCD and a shiny black glossy surface for the rest of the phone.  The black does attract fingerprints and at first this tends to put people off.  However, after a while the fingerprint effect psychologically diminishes upon itself so you do not really care.The keys are only average in tactile feel and comparable to a regular $200 phone.  This is surprising since I thought a top of the line phone would have quality keys with a firm solid response.  Not so here.  The keys spacing are not conducive to one-hand dialing without looking at the unit.The LCD is beautiful, with crisp text and accurate color display. If there's anything that's very well engineered on this phone it will be the LCD and camera (more on that below).  Truly world-class, I haven't quite seen an LCD look as good as on this phone.The camera is really good on this phone. Quite a far cry from the iphone and other Windows mobile phones.  Pictures come out reasonably sharp in daylight.  Low light is poor, but again, that's nothing unusual from any camera phone and the quality is still leaps and bounds better than the iphone. The camera does have a very bright LED that can amazingly light up a dead-dark environment a few feet ahead at max range.The exterior speaker is loud enough but only average in quality with a slightly tinny output.  I believe that my blackjack II's speaker is louder and cleaner in output, not significantly so, but enough to be noticeable.The rear kickstand, a widely marketed feature, is a pure gimmick that is poorly designed. Because it is not directly in the middle of the unit, the weight is not properly balanced. This means that an uneven surface, or a slight breeze could topple the unit over.  Tacky, I was so full of disgust when I tried it myself.  Needs to be completely reengineered or gotten rid of entirely.The ports are that of a micro USB, headphone, and power port. Nokia has decided not to use the USB port for power, however, so you have to lug around the power plug during travel if you take your laptop with you.  Not cool!There are no rubber boots for the ports on the phone.  Not a good sign - -water seepage can end up being a problem here.  And for those who say those boots tear off anyway, that is not necessarily true.  My old Blackjack II phone never had any of its boots torn off even though I heavily &quot;abused&quot; it for a year by inserting an removing countless times.Battery life is mediocre.  I could get about a day's worth of use with heavy web browsing and a few phone calls.  The battery gets much hotter than a normal smartphone does when in heavy discharge/charge mode.  It would be nice if Nokia could address this issue by producing a phone that doesn't feel like a mini hot plate to your face or hand.Accessories:The included car charger is a strange size.  It could not fit into my cig lighter.  Fortunately, I had a car charger from a different Nokia model that was compatible.  There is a proper USB cable included, which is a good thing since not everyone has a microUSB ported type of cable.  The travel charger is small enough.  There is no MicroSD card included, but these are cheap enough to buy for anyone who needs more than the regular 16GB of built in memory.  It's really nice that the memory is expandable like this, compared to the iphone where you are locked out from expansion options.  For music lovers, this means you can have a max of 24GB of memory and 16GB microsd's are on there way over soon, so that would mean 32gb of storage.  Not bad!Interface and response:The user interface is typical Nokia sybian.  That is, the menu set is fairly straight forward in operation.  The phone, however, has a sluggish feel to it.  Programs load sluggishly, making you wonder if you pressed the right button to launch it.  After a bit, the lag finally catches up.  I expect such typical behavior from a Windows Mobile phone,but the fact a Symbian phone does this is clearly unacceptable.  I'm not sure why the phone is so slow in execution; supposedly this phone lacks a multimedia processor and is clocked very low.  Regardless, it simply is slow, and that's all that matters to the end-user who will feel upset waiting at the response times.  This issue likely extends into the browser.The built-in web browser is much better than IE for windows mobile.  However, it is much worse than the Iphone's browser.  Pages render fairly well but loading is slow and scrolling stutters.  Although the phone was capable of launching youtube videos from the regular youtube site, there was so much stuttering going on that it was useless. Resource intensive sites like CNN are too slow to load, making it painful to view.  Zooming was horrible and nonintuitive. Again, this was a common issue on old phones from the early 2000s, but a top of the line phone for 2009?  The Iphone, by comparison, breezes through the most intense sites with ease.  This is sadly not a good web browsing phone. Since a 3G data plan with AT&amp;T; is so expensive, some of us would like a phone that's capable of browsing like an Iphone does.  Can't do that here.The phone does not support an international character set out of the box.  If you want to to view Chinese, for example, you cannot do this unless you mail in your phone to a Nokia service center.  This is a ludicrous option (did we timewarp to 1999?) in a time when extras should be downloadable from the manufacturer, even for a fee.  Since there's only one Nokia service center in the entire USA, you have to wait a long time for the turnaround.  To go without a phone that long is unacceptable.  The Iphone, by comparison, supports International characters right out of the box!The java stack on the N96 is awful.  It's too sensitive to security prohibitions and runs sluggishly, again.  I tried running Opera Mini, a java app, and it kept giving me security warnings every time I launched it, with no way to bypass those warnings.  The Opera mini program ran much slower than on my Blackjack II, a reflection, again, on the slow processing speed of the N96.The included GPS program was incredibly slow (do I hear an echo?) compared to the free Google Maps I've used on the iphone and the Blackjack.  Scrolling just to browse a map was painful and not something I could have any fun with.  In contrast, I love being able to just browse the maps on my other phones because it's quick and efficient.The N96 does have an auto position that uses the accelerometer.  It does work (disabled by default) but not all Symbian programs support it.  Therefore you are left with a rather quirky feature that may not activate when you expect it to.The T9 system is fast and pretty accurate. Honestly it's not going to get any better than this for input with a numeric keypad. The next step is have some hard alpha keys or an onscreen keyboard.As for phone quality, it sounded pretty good on both ends. Then again ,a 3G connection provides the crisp quality so the network infrastructure is more to the reason here.Conclusion:Nokia's N96 feels like a step back into time. It is sluggish in response, has poor included utilities, and its construction is not as good compared to its main rivals -- The iphone and the various Windows mobile platform phones.  The high price is not commensurate with its ability.  In particular, web browsing is awful.  A complete redesign is needed to make this phone faster and more intuitive.</td>

<td>I was extremely excited to open up the Nokia N96, because from its specs it looked to be one of the most powerful mobile phones on the market.  It certainly lived up to its expectations in some areas, and exceeds them in others, but fell short with some very common issues.For anyone looking for a camera/media device that also does phone calls, this might have been a serious contender.The media player works well for audio, the built-in FM tuner is great, and the internet radio feed was easy to use and loaded with content.  This phone does everything well, but not nearly well enough to justify its astronomical price tag.------------------Things Done Right:Browser - The browser on the phone rendered the pages I tried perfectly and it was very easy to navigate using the device.  Bookmarks and other features you'd want were all there.FM Radio - This worked like a charm!  It was very cool to have this in a mobile device.Light Weight - The phone weighs considerably less than my AT&amp;T; Fuze and Tilt.Massive Storage - The phone's best feature is its internal 16 GB of storage.Looks - Trust me when I say the phone looks even better in person.---------------Half-Way There:Mapping - Rather than relying on a live internet feed for maps, it had very detailed maps of the US right on the phone.  This is great if you are in an area with patchy service and need directions.  But, it's no Google Maps.  I've been spoiled by having Google Maps on my Windows Mobile phones for some time now, and while the mapping application on this phone is good, it's not Google Maps.  Plus, many of the advanced features of this application require an extra fee such as turn-by-turn directions and traffic reports.WiFi - Connecting the phone to my home wireless network with WPA/PSK was a breeze.  HOWEVER, many of the features  on the phone such as the mapping tool, internet radio, and others required use of data plan, even if you were connected via WiFi.  And despite trying, I could never get it to connect to my computer for WiFi Sharing.Help - The phone has online help for nearly every menu, most of which was well-written and useful.  Some of the more rare settings had no help, however.Camera - While this phone won't replace your $200 digital camera, it's better than what I've seen on most mobile phones.  I especially liked the on-screen menus for making adjustments on the fly.  The flash on the back of the camera is great for close-up subjects.Voice Command - There is a utility which reads you your messages to you, which was pretty neat.  And, you can dial your contacts through voice command, plus launch applications.  Unfortunately, that's all.  Voice command apps on other devices allow you to dial numbers as they are spoken, play specific media, or dictate text messages.-----------------More Work Needed:No Keyboard - This device lacks both a keyboard and touch screen, limiting all input to the numeric pad and a plethora of other buttons.  If you are a heavy text/emailer, this is going to be a deal-breaker for you.IM Difficult - The phone includes an IM application, but it was intimidating to configure with settings that I had no clue about.  Other phones include apps which are preconfigured for Yahoo, AIM, and MSN, but that was not the case here.  The manual and help were useless here.Micro USB - Every portable device I own uses Mini USB for sync and charging, but the Nokia N96 introduces the even smaller Micro USB.  That means that I need to carry yet another cable.No USB Charge - To make it worse, you cannot charge via USB.  While the phone comes with an AC charger and a car charger, its proprietary and means yet ANOTHER cable to carry.WMV Playback - Despite being touted as a media player, the phone would not play any of the WMV files I copied to it.  These were non-DRM files that worked fine on other phones.AGPS - The manual claims that the phone supports Assisted GPS (to speed up your positioning) but it would not work.Other Annoyances - There were a few other things that bothered me about the phone.  For instance, the music playback stuttered while using the phone for text messaging or mapping, and there was no option to disable the power-saving features while on AC power.--------------In Conclusion:For the price that this phone sells for, and comparing it to other devices on the market at half the price, I find it very hard to justify recommending the phone to anyone.Its only real saving grace is the 16 GB of storage, although some of its competitors will support memory cards with 4-16 GB of capacity.If the price came down considerably, and they issued a software upgrade to fix several of the above issues, it would probably beat its competitors hands-down.  But until then, I recommend passing this phone up for any of its half-priced competitors.</td>

<td>Reader's Digest Condensed Version:----------------------------------If you are looking for a phone geared more towards entertainment than providing a mobile office, this phone is for you.  If you are looking for a work-friendly phone, keep then perhaps theNokia E90 Communicator Unlocked Smartphone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS, MP3/Video Player, MicroSD--U.S. Version with Warranty (Red)would be a better (and more expensive) choice.Also, if you do buy this phone, make sure you buy a case/holster and a screen protector, as well.----------------------------------------------The Details...I had a hard time deciding on a star-rating for this phone because it is quite different from any other smartphone that I have used.  In the last couple of years, I have used:Blackberry 8300Helio OceanAT&amp;T; 8525Samsung SCH-i760  (my current phone)With the exception of the Helio Ocean, the Blackberry, AT&amp;T; and Samsung are business-centric phones.  All four feature a Qwerty keyboard.  The Helio, AT&amp;T; and Samsung each have their own numeric keypad in addition to the qwerty keyboard.All except for the Helio, did business applications, email, telephone communication, and syncing with easily -- that's what they were designed to do and that is the frame of reference that I am coming from.The Nokia N96, to me, isn't really aimed at the business centric crowd.  It is aimed at the multimedia &quot;I want to be entertained&quot; crowd (and a rich crowd, that must be judging by the price tag).Sure, the Nokia does email and &quot;office stuff&quot; ok -- but because they decided not to include the qwerty keyboard and opted to include so much multimedia stuff, it is clear that they decided &quot;work can wait&quot;.  Not necessarily a BAD thing... just different than I'm used to.So let's talk about what the Nokia IS designed for: talking, listening to music, taking pictures/video, and watching video.First, initial impressions about aesthetics:-- it is actually smaller than I'm used to (the Samsung).  It is lighter, shorter, and thinner.  You open the box and you certainly experience that &quot;WOW&quot; factor -- this phone is elegant and sophisticated.  The finish is the shiny &quot;piano finish&quot; that is so common.  Frankly, I HATE that because the moment you touch it, it is smudgy and that just drives me crazy.  The sides are metal but the back is a flimsy plastic and overall it just doesn't feel as solid as the other phones which were mostly metal cases.The screen is unbelievably gorgeous and bright.  No other smartphone I have used can hold a candle to it (I have not seen an iPhone so don't really have a basis of comparison there).The first thing I did was call someone.  Call quality is excellent -- also much better than any other cell phone I have used.  Very very close to Landline quality.  I paired it with aNokia 02705X6 BH-503 Bluetooth Stereo Headsetand sound quality (both receiving and talking better than most phones.  One of the things that is good about the call quality is the ability to really turn up the volume.  With other phones, I could seldom get the volume loud enough to hear over road/wind noise in the car.  With the N96, you actually have to turn it down because it can get uncomfortably loud.Even using the speaker phone is very good.  The N96 has &quot;stereo speakers&quot; and while you aren't going to throw out your home theater system, the speakers make the phone even better.Camera------The N96 has a 5 mp Carl Zeiss camera built in.  The camera can take stills or video at 30 frames per second.  I really like the camera because it allows me to be more spontaneous with taking pictures/video.  With my Samsung, the only time I used the cell phone feature was when I wrecked my car and wanted pictures of the evidence.  With Carl Zeiss optics (Zeiss is known for making the best optics in the world), you can take very solid photo album quality pictures with this camera.  It isn't going to replace your 12 MP SLR but for &quot;on-the-go&quot; pictures that you wouldn't otherwise catch, it is really nice to have.Music-----Again, the music quality on this device rivals any MP3 player.  I actually used it with a set of high-end Denon cans today and it was almost as good playing the CD through a PC.  I say &quot;almost&quot; because I was able to pick up some crackly artifact that resulted from the Nokia converting my higher bit-rate recordings to a lower bit-rate for space considerations.  But this trade off is worth it.  With 16 GB of main memory, I have over 3 hours of music loaded on the phone with space to spare.Keypad and controls:--------------------I'm still not sold on the T9 only keyboard.  I read a previous commenter about how you can learn to type faster with T9 than Qwerty and I intend to try it.  I do have to say that T9 typing seems to work better than I remembered it on previous phones.I'm not wild about the feel of the buttons.  They are all flat and do not feel &quot;solid&quot; to me.  I could see them cracking with a lot of use.Web and email-------------Even though this is a smaller device, the screen is actually larger than my Samsung.  You wouldn't think a couple of pixels in either direction would be that big a deal but it really helps with page display.Video-----I believe the N96 was designed around this feature.  Downloading videos from Amazon was very easy and the playback is just like a tiny TV.  To me, though, this is the least &quot;useful&quot; feature of the phone.  If I'm sitting around and have some time to kill, I'm more likely to check email, listen to music or just plain read.Battery life-------------Average battery life.  I was able to use the cell phone for about 1.25 hours of talk time and 3 hours of listening to music before the battery died.  That means if you use your phone a lot, you'll need to keep it plugged in (fortunately, the phone comes with both an AC charger and a car charger -- very unusual in this day and age).Syncing with your PC--------------------Included with the phone is a software suite that will allow you to sync with Outlook etc.  Installation took awhile (I had to download .NET) but getting all my contact data onto the device was a snap.  Transferring music wasn't great -- it could be that I just don't have the sync settings set up correctly.  However, the N96 requires Windows Media Player 11 for the syncing.  I have A LOT of music loaded in WMP and didn't want to load EVERYTHING on.  I tried to create a playlist to identify just what I wanted transferred over.  Unfortunately, it still grabbed more than I wanted it to.Miscellaneous--------------- The USB cable that comes with it is not your standard USB cable -- at least on the end that connects to the phone.  It has a smaller connector than most devices (like MP3 players, external disk drives, my other cell phones, etc.  So if you want to sync up at home and at work, you'll have to hang on tight to this cable (or buy another one online).-- The Nokia does provide both a car and standard AC charger which is good since you will need to keep this thing constantly plugged in.  There is no way to accommodate an extended battery at this point -- it would require a new &quot;back plate&quot; (this is the approach that AT&amp;T; adopted for their 8525).  Hopefully, this will be something Nokia will provide down the road.  However, I will say that this device provides a LOT of options to tweak the features to maximize battery performance.  For example, you can specify during what hours to go fetch email.  There's not much point in fetching email 24/7 when you may only want access to it 12x5.  You can also set it up to shut down during night hours etc.-- The screen is not a touch screen.  Also, if you want to protect it, you're probably going to want to get a HTC Touch Diamond JAVOScreen (Ultra-Clear) + JAVOedge MetaCharger Bundle (Euro) screen protector to hide the finger prints and prevent scratches.  I had one left over from my 8525 and it isn't a perfect fit but works good enough.-- You will also want to invest in a good case/holster.  I can't believe that Nokia is selling a 700.00 phone with a screen like this and yet they don't even provide the most basic protection required.  Even the bluetooth headphones came with their own carrying pouch.</td>

<td>I currently own the LG Dare and Blackberry Curve, so I get the opportunity to use a &quot;dumb phone&quot; and a &quot;smartphone&quot; on a regular basis.  This Nokia N96 is sort of a compromise between the two.  It has the strengths of a smart phone while also delivering the pluses of the normal phone.  There are many pluses and minuses already mentioned by other reviewers, so I will not repeat the obvious ones.  Here are a few that really caught my attention:The Nokia Software loads about 700mb of software on your computer which would be fine if it all worked like it was intended.  I spent a lot of time searching forums for help on connecting and updating the device with the software.The 5mp camera is fantastic!  I also like the small camera on the front of the device.  Nice touch.  Though, this device is loaded with so many features and options, it could be overwhelming to the technically challenged.The TV out capability is excellent.  Home videos show clearly on my flat screen and movies display very well.  It's like the Swiss Army Knife of cell phones!I love the FM radio feature.  A good option that should be added to more portable devices.The phone is about the size of my LG Dare, but just a bit thicker.  It fits in your hand quite well.  Calls are clear.  A full querty keyboard would be a welcome addition, though.I use the device on T-Mobile (non 3G).  It works quite well, though you do give up certain features.The 2.8 inch screen is an absolute delight.  Crisp and clear.  Excellent for playing games and watching video.The N96, to me, is more of a designer gadget.  Those that love high tech devices with lots of features will drool over this phone.  It does everything pretty well, but compared with other phones, it doesn't really excel at anything.  It's definitely not the IPhone killer, but more of a trendy substitute. There are a lot of great phone choices out there.  The Nokia N96 would not be my first choice if my choice was utility (LG Dare).  Nor would it be my first choice for a smartphone (Blackberry or Samsung Omnia).  It would rank pretty high on my list of phones if I were looking for an all in one multimedia phone that is somewhat future proof (sans touchscreen and querty keyboard).</td>

<td>I was excited to try this phone out as I have been using Windows Mobile devices for awhile (currently using the AT&amp;T; Tilt) and never been completely satisfied with their performance. A 16 gig phone geared for music and video looked right up my alley. Having used this phone for several days and tried as many features as possible, I'm not nearly as enamored with it as I hoped. For a $600 phone, I expected something far more polished. This seems to have been rushed into production and has quite a few bugs and problems. Let's run down the good stuff first.PROS:- Light, compact form factor. Considerably lighter than my Tilt.- 16 gig of memory. Excellent amount of included space, and can take a microSD card for even more media files.- Beautiful screen. Video is sharp and colorful, although it could be a bit brighter. But hard to complain with the quality of the picture. See below though for more comments on video playback. It also is much more visible in sunlight than my Tilt is.- 5 gig camera with flash and video capability. I debated whether to include this under the &quot;pros&quot; as I didn't find the quality of the images produced by the camera all that great, particularly indoors. But having a flash and being able to record video with it is still at least better than not having it at all.- Excellent sound quality and nice loud speakers. Includes two speakers for &quot;sort-of&quot; stereo playback. This phone can really produce some serious volume, I was quite impressed. Granted, the sound quality out of the speakers is not going to blow anyone away. But it's pretty good regardless. And make sure you turn the volume down before using the headphones, it will totally blast you away! If you regularly try to listen to music in noisy situations where volume is crucial, you will know how important this can be.- Excellent multimedia features included. FM radio, internet radio, podcasts, etc. Most of these I could do on my WM phone, but great to have them included for seamless integration right on the phone.- Good included accessories. Includes a remote with speakerphone, car charger, TV out cables, free game, etc. Better package overall than most phones.Now for my fairly long list of negatives.CONS:- Lack of fullsize keyboard and/or touchscreen. I was surprised to see there was no touchscreen on this phone, that makes it really hard to compete with other smartphones in the same class like the iPhone and any Windows Mobile phone. With my Tilt, I not only have a full QWERTY keyboard (which granted, is not the greatest way to enter text for most people, but nice for things like passwords and WEP keys) you can use a wide variety of entry methods that work with the touchscreen. I personally use ones like Fitaly and Touchpad which can give good speed and yet still easily handle non-standard text at any time. One of the things I particularly find annoying with phones like this that use T9 is that you often have to turn it on and off which requires going to the menu. Likewise with the multi-key entry of letters and numbers, you have to constantly switch back and forth, which takes far longer on this phone than just about any other smartphone I've used. It's incredibly tedious and if you use your phone as a PDA or anything other than quick texting, you should probably look at better options.- Problems using Wifi versus AT&amp;T; data plans. I personally use pay-as-you-go currently as I don't need to pay for monthly cell phone service and almost always have access to Wifi networks. With my Tilt, it's a simple matter of a one-time configuration of the phone for any Wifi network and it will use that automatically versus accessing the AT&amp;T; data network. This phone just would not cooperate with that. It often would switch over and use the data plan and charge me no matter how I configured it, even going into the settings and making my Wifi the default. Worse, you would have to do this *every* time you access a new Wifi network, setting it up as a default and then switching it back, and even then, it seems to randomly hit the data network and charge me for usage without warning. And to make it even more annoying, just about every time it needs to access the internet, it has to ask me what network to use, the Wifi or AT&amp;T.; Why bother setting a default (and configuring it for automatic) if it's not going to just use it?? It's almost like the phone is trying to get you to use the paid data plan whether you have access to Wifi or not. Just about everything else on this phone I can kind of deal with, or work around, but this is so frustrating for me and COSTS ME MONEY that it's a total dealbreaker. So if you want to use Wifi as your primary data access network, and not pay the significant cost of a monthly data plan, you will probably want to use a different phone.- Bare-bones email and web applications. The email and web apps that came with the phone didn't do much for me. Emails with HTML were not properly formatted at all, and the options for handling email as well were very limited compared to what I am used to. When I tried to adjust my settings, it wiped out my custom POP settings and I had to enter them all over again (which due to the lack of keyboard is particularly annoying). The web browser was not quite as bad, but navigating the pages without a touchscreen is slow and tedious and it kept popping up the &quot;overall&quot; page view when it was inconvenient. The back button brings up little thumbnails of the pages but for some reason they were often blank and kept skipping the actual page I wanted to get back to. I was easily able to load on the free Opera Mini browser however, which gave me a far better experience. If you use a smartphone, I highly recommend grabbing a copy of it. I've not yet found a free email replacement, I'd probably have to pay to get an email application that just does the basics that I would have liked to come with the device.- While there's certainly plenty of games on Symbian and for N-Gage, the library of applications is a bit more limited. Also just the fact that it doesn't use a touchscreen makes game play often more limiting and somewhat more tedious as it relies totally on keystrokes, particularly the types of games I prefer (card games, adventure games, etc.) Still, the games offered were decent enough and the graphics top-notch for a mobile phone, and I do notice more places offering Symbian versions of their software. Both my Hava player and Roboform mobile apps had versions that ran okay on the N96 (although not flawless).- Performance issues. My main hope was that this device would be zippier and less prone to locking up than the Tilt. Unfortunately this was not the case. The processor is downgraded from the previous N95 model, most likely done to allow them to also downgrade the battery as well but I can't say if the problems I saw are a result of this or typical for Symbian phones. While the video was sharp and beautiful to look at, I still experienced pauses and skips...particularly with the sample videos included! Almost all of the ones included with the phone did not play smoothly all the way through. I had better luck with some small videos that I synced to the device and a couple TV episodes that I downloaded from Amazon Unbox. While they did not always play perfectly, they were at least watchable for 95% of the time. The phone itself also often temporarily pauses and/or freezes and a few times locked up on me completely. Unlike the Tilt which has a reset option, I could not figure out how to unlock this phone when it froze other than to remove the back and pull the battery out. Very annoying.- Camera image quality. It's important when evaluating cameras to realize that megapixels means little about quality. So getting 5 MP with the phone means mostly that the images it takes will just take up more space on the phone. They certainly aren't of a quality that I would be interested in printing them out which is where the 5 MP would be of any use. They are of similar quality to most cellphones...which means only good for snapshots when you have nothing better on-hand. And indoors in anything other than very bright light, they were definitely worse than what my Tilt is able to take, even though the camera includes a flash.- Battery life. Barely passable, no better than my Tilt which was equally a battery hog. You definitely need to charge it every night and if you use your phone much, you may find you need to charge it during the day as well.- Voice control. This is one of those phones that you don't really train, it just recognizes the names you speak and picks the default phone. Also some basic application control. This type of VR can be problematic if you have people with similar names and I just much prefer training my own names and commands as I can with the software on WM phones. And of course, there's nothing in the manual about how to even use this feature.- Live TV. Touted as a feature, but won't work for most people due to very limited coverage right now. You're probably much better off just getting a Slingbox or Hava which will work with a wide range of phones these days, including this one.- Non-standard USB cable. May seem like a small nit, but things like this just annoy me. Why not use a standard mini-USB cable, which most people have multiple ones of, and also a USB cable that will simultaneous charge the device? It's really annoying when you are syncing the device, moving videos, etc. and it runs out of juice. Using this new micro USB cable means I'll need to buy another one for travel....and probably another cable for charging in different places.- GPS. I only tested the GPS briefly as this was another area where it seemed to insist on using the data plan rather than Wifi. But I just don't see the benefit in using a GPS on such a small screen and paying monthly fees for it, when you can buy dedicated GPS units for as little as $100 these days that are larger and easier to read while driving, and with much better features. This GPS didn't work nearly as well as my simple Garmin unit and didn't even compare with running TomTom on my Tilt which I don't pay any fee to use (other than the purchase cost of the software).- No case or screen protector. For the price, some kind of cheap case would be nice. The device comes with a plastic skin covering the front and back that would do nicely as a screen protector, but for some reason, they plastered a big &quot;NOKIA&quot; over the front so it can't be used. The screen and phone itself really shows fingerprints and smudges pretty readily so a screen protector would have been highly appreciated.- Nokia PC Suite issues. I didn't have too much trouble syncing my Outlook contacts, but had various issues with other parts of the PC Suite. Forget using the music application, for some reason it didn't read 99% of the tags in my MP3s, so had to use Media Player to sync music to the device. The video manager as well did not work very well for me. It handled small videos okay, but as soon as it got to anything with length, it locked up on me. Took me several tries to convert videos of more than 100 meg in size. I want to try and do some conversions myself and see what videos it really can handle, as I have other mobile video conversion software that does a good job, but I know already it doesn't seem to handle Divx video which is a shame.- Bare bones user manual. The manuals included cover the basics, but you won't find much help in them if you need more than just &quot;getting started&quot; information. For instance, I was trying to figure out where I turn on T9 predictive text, but there's absolutely no information in the manual on text entry whatsoever. I went to the Nokia site to see if the support section had a better manual to download, but nope. You better be good at figuring stuff out on your own to use this phone (and yes, I did figure out where the T9 setting was).- Other issues. I seem to just run into random problems with this phone. YouTube videos for instance would not play at all, regardless of which browser I used. It doesn't seem to like most of my album art in the music player, and does not always play smoothly if playing in the background while doing other activities on the phone (web browsing for instance). The microSD slot is harder than most to get the card in and out of. The build quality is very plastic, cheap feeling. And there are just some things that make it obvious it was kind of rushed to market. For instance, there's a settings screen for a &quot;scroll wheel&quot; even though the phone doesn't even have one! Would be nice if it did, but to have settings in there for something that does not even exist on it, makes me wonder how much testing they really gave this phone before releasing.To summarize, this is a phone I really wanted to like. It's got huge potential as a portable media device and phone, but there are just too many problem areas to recommend it over other devices in the same price range.</td>

<td>I purchased this after I returned a N85-3 to another dealer, this phone has it all and works as good if not better than the old outdated N95-3.There are so many things to point out it would take me forever to put it all down but from a person that has owned a N73, Two N81's, a N78, a N95-2, Three N95-3's, Two N95-4's, a N85-3 and out of all of them the N96-3 is the best of all.If you would like the best Nokia that is being produced right now I would say pick up a N96-3,it works great and is really fun to use.</td>
