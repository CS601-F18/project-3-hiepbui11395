Phone with otterbox too small.</th><th>I have an IPhone 4s and have no problems It fits great and I wonder if you have a different version or not but my phone fits great and I have it on now as I answer this question. Maybe you should Send an E-mail to Otter box By the way you do have a defender otter box correct?</th></tr><tr><th>b004v9htua</th><th></th><th></th><th>ihavegalaxies4willthisbeltclipfit</th><th>I do not know.</th></tr><tr><th>b004v9htua</th><th></th><th></th><th>What color is this?</th><th>It's black.</th></tr><tr><th>b004v9htua</th><th></th><th></th><th>Does anyone know if the Ipod Touch 4th gen Otterbox Defender case will fit this belt clip?</th><th>I have an iPhone 4s and I believe it will fit this belt clip. If the two devices are the same size I believe it will work fine. It is hard to say for sure but the price is right.</th></tr><tr><th>b004v9htua</th><th></th><th></th><th>Would this be compatible for Otter box Armor series for iphone 4s ?</th><th>I'm not sure. I purchased my 3rd Otter Box Armor holder from damage I had caused, and replaced what I had.</th></tr><tr><th>b004v9htua</th><th></th><th></th><th>Does the clip on the back turn so you can clip it different ways on your belt?</th><th>Yes, it does. I use use the horizontal mode but it will work vertical, also.</th></tr><tr><th>b004v9htua</th><th></th><th></th><th>I have the otterbox commuter case on my iphone 4. Will this belt clip work on the cummuter case?</th><th>no</th></tr><tr><th>b004v9htua</th><th></th><th></th><th>I have Iphone 4. Does not fit in this case . Too small. How do I make it fit?</th><th>Unless you also have the rubber sleeve that fits over the IPhone 4 you will not be able to use this clip. The rubber sleeve is very durable.</th></tr><tr><th>b004v9htua</th><th></th><th></th><th>Does this beltclip fit a Sprint Flash 4G</th><th>All I know is that it was an exact replacement for the case and clip that I first had and at a good price. I have an I phone 4 and I'm happy with it.</th></tr><tr><th>b004v9htua</th><th></th><th></th><th>Is this real Otterbox, or a knock off?</th><th>This is real</th></tr></table><form id='reviewSearchForm' method='POST'>
